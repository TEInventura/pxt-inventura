## Blocks

This extension contains functions to help students perform the projects and activities proposed in the [Inventura](https://www.positivoteceduc.com.br/inventura/). 

The Heat Index blocks calculates the [heat index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index) based on temperature and air humidity.

The first block receives air humidity (given in %) and temperature in celsius (째C), returning the heat index also in celsius (째C). The second block uses the temperature in fareinheigh (째F) and calculates the index also in fareinheigh (째F).

For both blocks, the air humidity must be between 0% and 100%.
